# 🏠 Airbnb Paris Analysis


This project explores the **Airbnb rental landscape in Paris**, analyzing listing prices, availability, host behavior, and regulatory impact using **Python and Jupyter Notebook**.

The goal is to understand:

- How pricing varies across **neighborhoods and property types**
- Which hosts dominate the market — **individuals vs. commercial operators**
- The **effect of regulations** on Airbnb business activity in Paris

* **Regulatory Shift (2017):** Significant slowdown in new hosts entering the market.
* **Resilient Demand:** Despite fewer new listings, customer demand stayed stable.
* **Pricing Trends:** Competition lowered prices pre-2017, but post-regulation supply constraints pushed prices upward.
